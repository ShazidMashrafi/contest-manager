    ii. The sites may have subdomains, country domains and others. block those
3. Restrict usb storage devices.
4. The restrictions should persists after reboots and others.
5. The ip system block should be updated every once in a while cause ip of blocked sites may change.
6. The unrestrict command should properly remove the restrictions

the restrict command should be modular. It should use the contest-manager/cli/restrict.py for the system. The restrict.py will handle the system. It will call for utility functions in utils folder. Create new ones or use existing ones. Make the system modular.
