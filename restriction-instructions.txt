    i. The sites may have dynamic ip, ipv6. Block all of those.
    ii. ensure proper handle of https and http too.
    iii. The sites may have subdomains, country domains and others. block those. sites with www and without should be treated as same
    iv. Although subdomains having fonts, cdn, static should be allowed
    v. The restrictor should account for subdomains of a domain and the domain included in the blacklist itself.
    vi. the system should not block sites not included in the blacklist.
3. Restrict usb storage devices.
4. The restrictions should persists after reboots and others.
5. The ip system block should be updated every once in a while cause ip of blocked sites may change.
6. The unrestrict command should properly remove the restrictions
7. the restrict command should be modular. It should use the contest-manager/cli/restrict.py for the system. The restrict.py will handle the system. It will call for utility functions in utils folder. Create new ones or use existing ones. Make the system modular.
